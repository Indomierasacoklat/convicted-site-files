# Near support 

the world is moving from a "value capture" economy to a "value creation" economy and needs a new set of rules that democratizes access to resources for creators and makes value creation as rewarding as it should be in the 21st century.

we believe that in the near future most resources other than intellectual and human capital will become commodities. As a producer of knowledge-based assets, the creative industries will become the main drivers of economic growth in the world.

We are focusing on the creative industries and creating the most advanced decentralized protocol for the maker economy. We want to make it the fundamental infrastructure for unlocking the full potential of creators around the world.
