# What is Convicted?
Convicted is a P2E game on the WAX blockchain in the smart farming genre. You will have to mine resources, fight bosses, and take over the prison business. 
We're trying to bring new elements to the P2E genre that will give players a new perspective on this area.

We strive to create things like:
- In-game friend additions
A large community that can interact with each other. The more friends you have, the faster you'll get through prison challenges
- Cooperative battles against bosses and each other
Competitions and wins in our events will be rewarded. Leaderboards for players who are the first to reach heights or regional leaderboards.
- The first NFT game with good customization
We plan to sell limited quantities of items that will only improve the appearance of your character.
- Level dependency
A leveled account in our game will have value. The higher your level, the more profitable
