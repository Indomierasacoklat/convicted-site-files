# What is Convicted?
Convicted is a P2E game on the WAX blockchain in the smart farming genre. You will have to mine resources, fight bosses, and take over the prison business. 
We're trying to bring new elements to the P2E genre that will give players a new perspective on this area.

We strive to create things like:
- In-game friend additions

A large community that can interact with each other. The more friends you have, the faster you'll get through prison challenges
- Cooperative battles against bosses and each other

Competitions and wins in our events will be rewarded. Leaderboards for players who are the first to reach heights or regional leaderboards.
- The first NFT game with good customization

We plan to sell limited quantities of items that will only improve the appearance of your character.
- Level dependency

A leveled account in our game will have value. The higher your level, the more profitable

# What are internal tokens?
Internal tokens are tokens of our game. You can earn them with in-game NFTs or buy them on the Alcor exchange.

There are three economic currencies in the game: "Rubls", "Cigarettes", and "Food".
Each currency will be tied to a specific token: Rubl, Cigarettes, and Food correspond to tokens: CRUB (Rubl), CSUG (Cigarettes), CFOD (Food).

# Where and how to buy internal tokens?
Tokens can be purchased on the [Alcor exchange](https://wax.alcor.exchange) when they become available there.

You need to connect your Wax Cloud Wallet or Anchor wallet to the Alcor exchange. Click Market and find our token pairs, which will be published here in the near future.

# When is the game scheduled to come out?
Initially, we give ourselves a lot more time to prepare, and we put the game's release date at the end of the third quarter of 2022.

We plan to release the game on the main network immediately in 3d so that we can sell custom stuff from the first release.

Before that, we will have a strong beta test where we have to do everything we promise.
