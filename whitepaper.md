# About the game
You go to prison as an ordinary kid. In order to survive in these difficult conditions, you have to fight for the right to life. Fight with other prisoners and if you win you get a well-deserved reward - a cigarette. If you are strong in cooking, go to the kitchen and cook food. Start your journey of roofing business, conquering one prison after another.
But not all victories are easy, some bosses can't be defeated alone. You'll have to assemble your own team or join someone else's team to kill the most powerful boss. Do not miss the opportunity to keep your physical form at an appropriate level. A convict without a tattoo is not a convict. So put a tattoo on your body - they will increase your credibility among the prisoners.

# Аbout the game from the technical side
Convicted is an NFT game built on blockchain technology. We use Binance Smart Chain and want to prove that a good crypto game can easily exist on this blockchain.
We have several tasks before us that we want to to implement within this project:
1. Blocking players who use multiple accounts 
We want to create a system of tracking players data with the consequent blocking of players that are different from the previous ones. To solve this problem, we will bring in specialists of this direction.
2. Creation of the NFT game on Binance Smart Chain with several internal game tokens
3. Creation of a stable game economy 
To solve this problem we will invite experts in economics.
4. Creation of the first NFT game with customization 
In our game, apart from NFT objects giving bonuses, there will be normal character skins and illustrations.

# Rules of the game

> Multi-accounting is strictly forbidden. If we suspect you of this type of activity, you will be blocked and it will be nearly impossible for you to get back into the game. 
> All foul play is forbidden. All accounts that try to hack the game will be blocked forever.
