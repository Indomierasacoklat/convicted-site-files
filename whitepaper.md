# Whitepaper Convicted

The first version of the "Convicted" technical documentation was written in the middle of 2021. The impetus for its implementation was a huge amount of failed P2E projects without the slightest desire to understand and make sense of the technology. 

>The author of the documentation is Kirill Makhnev and all rights belong to Vers Corporation, Delaware. 

# Our goal
Our main goal for the project is its economic sustainability, which will be worked out down to the smallest detail. We want to show developers and players that blockchain games are not a scam, but a technology with great future potential if developed responsibly and with understanding.

I hope we can do it =)

>In the game, we will implement the hypothesis that the tokens of the game will be stocks, where there are winners and losers. We think that our game will have a cyclical market due to the economic mechanics that you will learn about next.

# Our tasks
Our main tasks in the project are:
- **Blocking players using multiple accounts** 
We want to create a system of tracking players with subsequent blocking. To solve this task we will involve specialists in this area.
- **Creating an NFT game with a lot of in-game tokens**
- **Creating a stable game economy** 
To solve this problem, we rely on the stock economy and want to involve an economist-analyst to implement the most balanced game.
- **Creating the first NFT game with adequate customization** 
In addition to NFT bonus items, our game will have normal character skins and illustrations. They won't give any advantages, but they will decorate your character.

>What is presented in the White Paper is not a definitive document; the mechanics of the game will be improved.

# About the game
You go to prison as an ordinary kid. In order to survive in these difficult conditions, you have to fight for the right to life. Fight with other prisoners and if you win you get a well-deserved reward - a cigarette. If you are strong in cooking, go to the kitchen and cook food. Start your journey of roofing business, conquering one prison after another.

But not all victories are easy, some bosses can't be defeated alone. You'll have to assemble your own team or join someone else's team to kill the most powerful boss. Do not miss the opportunity to keep your physical form at an appropriate level. A convict without a tattoo is not a convict. So put a tattoo on your body - they will increase your credibility among the prisoners.

# Rules of the game

1. **Multi-accounting is strictly forbidden**
If we suspect you of this type of activity, you will be blocked and it will be nearly impossible for you to return to the game. 
2. **All foul play is forbidden**
All accounts that try to hack, hack the game - will be blocked forever.
3. **Prohibited any collusion or circumvention of the rules of the game established in the documentation**

>The rules may be supplemented and changed over time.

# Allocation tokens
Token allocation data will be available once the future project is determined.

# Distribution of funds received
>**Game development - 25%**

Most of the money will go to the development of the 3d version of the game, the development of the interface and internal mechanics of the game.

>**Cash distribution pool for tokens - 15%**

Each "Convicted" game token will generate passive income for its holders in the form of WAX tokens. Each token will receive 5% of all project revenues.
You can read more about this in the [WhitePaper](http://161.35.217.137:9000/whitepaper).

>**Team - 15%**

The Team will own 15% of each token of our project. These tokens will be locked in for 6 months completely with planned distribution.

>**Liquidity - 25%**

We will take care of the liquidity of our tokens. Our plan is to regularly replenish the pools of tokens, so as not to traumatize the market.

>**Development fund - 10%**

This fund will shape the future development of our infrastructure and company in P2E game technology. We plan to please you in the future with even more serious games in this direction.

>**Marketing - 5%**

>**Non-preliminary expenses - 5%**

# DAO. Profit distribution for holding tokens.

DAO can be compared to a business or stock ownership with dividends. By buying or earning part of our game tokens, you become a co-owner of the game and profit from any income of our project. 

This applies to all tokens - CRUB (Ruble), CCIG (Cigarettes), CFOD (Food).

>We will redirect 15% of revenue from all sales to project tokens. A portion of the money generated from the sale of NFTs will be formed into a specific cash pool in the form of WAX tokens. This pool will be spread over months so as not to traumatize the market.

## Example
Example: By buying or earning a % of any of the three tokens of our game, you will receive a % of income from all game sales in the form of WAX.

- Our game's income is made up of:
- 5% commission from the game's marketplace, in the form of WAX
- WAX from the withdrawal of internal tokens by players from the game
- Sales of NFT and other cosmetic items for the game
- Login sales to the game

>Income in the form of WAX can be withdrawn once a month. The day of eligibility will be random.

## What form will this take?
It's very simple, in the game itself once a month you have the opportunity to pick up your WAX.

>The amount of WAX you receive will depend on the number of WAX tokens in your account. 

# What is it for?
This system should solve the following problems:
- Some real value of internal tokens will be determined
- Attract large investors in internal tokens
- Will make it more meaningful for players to retain internal tokens from sale

# Tokens information
There are three economic currencies in the game: "Rubl", "Cigarettes", "Food", as well as two resources: "Authority", "Energy" and one indicator "Level". All of these parameters will interact with each other and create an economic balance.

Each currency will be tied to a specific token: Rubl, Cigarettes and Food correspond to tokens: CRUB (Rubl), CCIG (Cigarettes), CFOD (Food). Thus, you will not only be able to get the game currency you need with NFT, but also buy it from the market. 

![Tokens](https://github.com/verscorp/convicted-site-files/blob/main/images/tokens.svg) 

>You can exchange the game currency for tokens at any time, but you will be charged a certain amount of WAX tokens

# How does it work?
Initially, a certain amount of energy is spent along with the NFT item. Rewards are determined according to the level of the "jail space" to which the NFT item belongs, the average NFT mining, the amount of NFT and the mining time.

The type of resource is determined by the type of NFT.

![Chema](https://github.com/verscorp/convicted-site-files/blob/main/images/cxema.png)

Earned currency can be spent on crafting new NFT, repair items, as well as exchange for tokens, withdrawal to a purse and sell on the stock exchange.

# NFT
## Types of NFTs

There will be many different NFT items in the game. They will be divided into three main categories:
- In-game.
- Intermediary 
- Custom

**In-game**
![Chema](https://github.com/verscorp/convicted-site-files/blob/main/images/first.png)

This list of NFTs includes: 
- Weapons.
- Types of crime
- Chef Certificates.
These are the basic NFTs with which the player begins to earn resources.

**Intermediate**
![Chema](https://github.com/verscorp/convicted-site-files/blob/main/images/first.png)

These NFTs are somewhere between custom items and in-game items for earning. 

These include:
- Partial tattoos.
- Partially clothing (shorts, underpants, T-shirt, T-shirt, etc.)
- Collection cards
- Expendables

**Custom**
![Chema](https://github.com/verscorp/convicted-site-files/blob/main/images/first.png)

This list includes:
- Prison Cameras
- Characters
- Clothes.

They do not give an advantage to the players, but will reflect only your authority, your coolness in the eyes of other cellmates.
