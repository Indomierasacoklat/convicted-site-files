# DAO. Profit distribution for holding tokens.

DAO can be compared to a business or stock ownership with dividends. By buying or earning part of our game tokens, you become a co-owner of the game and profit from any income of our project. 

This applies to all tokens - CRUB (Ruble), CCIG (Cigarettes), CFOD (Food).

>We will redirect 15% of revenue from all sales to project tokens. A portion of the money generated from the sale of NFTs will be formed into a specific cash pool in the form of WAX tokens. This pool will be spread over months so as not to traumatize the market.

# Example
Example: By buying or earning a % of any of the three tokens of our game, you will receive a % of income from all game sales in the form of WAX.

- Our game's income is made up of:
- 5% commission from the game's marketplace, in the form of WAX
- WAX from the withdrawal of internal tokens by players from the game
- Sales of NFT and other cosmetic items for the game
- Login sales to the game

>Income in the form of WAX can be withdrawn once a month. The day of eligibility will be random.

# What form will this take?
It's very simple, in the game itself once a month you have the opportunity to pick up your WAX.

>The amount of WAX you receive will depend on the number of WAX tokens in your account. 

# What is it for?
This system should solve the following problems:
- Some real value of internal tokens will be determined
- Attract large investors in internal tokens
- Will make it more meaningful for players to retain internal tokens from sale
