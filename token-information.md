# DAO. Profit distribution for holding tokens.

DAO can be compared to a business or stock ownership with dividends. By buying or earning part of our game tokens, you become a co-owner of the game and profit from any income of our project. 

This applies to all tokens - CRUB (Ruble), CCIG (Cigarettes), CFOD (Food).

>We will redirect 15% of revenue from all sales to project tokens. A portion of the money generated from the sale of NFTs will be formed into a specific cash pool in the form of WAX tokens. This pool will be spread over months so as not to traumatize the market.

## Example
Example: By buying or earning a % of any of the three tokens of our game, you will receive a % of income from all game sales in the form of WAX.

- Our game's income is made up of:
- 5% commission from the game's marketplace, in the form of WAX
- WAX from the withdrawal of internal tokens by players from the game
- Sales of NFT and other cosmetic items for the game
- Login sales to the game

>Income in the form of WAX can be withdrawn once a month. The day of eligibility will be random.

## What form will this take?
It's very simple, in the game itself once a month you have the opportunity to pick up your WAX.

>The amount of WAX you receive will depend on the number of WAX tokens in your account. 

# What is it for?
This system should solve the following problems:
- Some real value of internal tokens will be determined
- Attract large investors in internal tokens
- Will make it more meaningful for players to retain internal tokens from sale

# Tokens information
There are three economic currencies in the game: "Rubl", "Cigarettes", "Food", as well as two resources: "Authority", "Energy" and one indicator "Level". All of these parameters will interact with each other and create an economic balance.

Each currency will be tied to a specific token: Rubl, Cigarettes and Food correspond to tokens: CRUB (Rubl), CCIG (Cigarettes), CFOD (Food). Thus, you will not only be able to get the game currency you need with NFT, but also buy it from the market.

>You can exchange the game currency for tokens at any time, but you will be charged a certain amount of WAX tokens

# How does it work?
Initially, a certain amount of energy is spent along with the NFT item. Rewards are determined according to the level of the "jail space" to which the NFT item belongs, the average NFT mining, the amount of NFT and the mining time.

The type of resource is determined by the type of NFT.
